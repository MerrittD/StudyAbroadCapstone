# Testing for Database ORM and API-WIP 

## How to Use

The files in this file must be in the same file location as databaseConfiguation.py, databaseORM.py, and newTestDatabase.bd
These files are located in the folder above this one in the hierarchy: "Database"

All these files were moved to this file becasue all testing was completed and verified. The files were moved for
organizational pruposes. 



## Files

 - README.md: This document
 - testingAPImethods.py: tests all methods in API which directly interact with the database
 - testingDatabaseAdd+Remove+Modify.py: test database ORM to ensure proper database relationships and entity functions.
 - testingDatabaseSetup: tests creating tables and adding programs

 

## Known Issues

All files function as intended in Database and API methods which change the database.
