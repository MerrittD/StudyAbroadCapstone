#This file is to be run upon initial setup of the database, and should pull from a 
#   backup file inorder to populate new database.
# The testing for removing and modifing programs is contained in the file "testingDatabaseAdd+Remove.py"


# Constructors: 
#   - Provider(self, name):
#   - Program(self, name, com, res, intern, cost, cost_stipulations, description, url):
#   - Language(self, name):
#   - Location(self, city, country):
#   - Term(self, name):
#   - Area(self, name):
#   - Admin(self, username, password): 

# How to add a program to a provider: 
#   Use constructor to create a new provider
#   use the add_object or remove_object methods and add and remove
#   
#   You can add or remove: 
#       - A Program from a Provider
#
#       - A Language from a Program
#       - A Term from a Program
#       - A Location from a Program
#       - An Area from a Program

# How to add and remove relationships between objects (example- connect a language to a program): 
#  provider.add_program(programName)
#  provider.remove_program(programName)
#  provider.save_to_database()

#  program.add_language(language)
#  program.add_area(area)
#  program.add_term(term)
#  program.add_location(location)

#  program.remove_language(language)
#  program.remove_area(area)
#  program.remove_term(term)
#  program.remove_location(location)


# This script below is to test all methods for the database
#    I have used the data on the "Dummy Study Abroad Programs Data" on the Project Drive
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T_cO_Zb0LjXWC506Ji134R-u3nhHM4E-GgsWaxd-maw/edit?usp=sharing
