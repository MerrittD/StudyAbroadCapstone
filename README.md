##Api Setup

###Running the API

####Requirements: 
Flask,Flask-SQLAlchemy, Python 3 (newest release)

####Starting:
From the command prompt, navigate to the location of the API file. Run the API using the command 'python API-WIP.py'
This will start the API on a local host and print out the IP used for conneting to the instnace. Simply put this in
either postman or chrome to test the API.

####Issues: 
Currently, this API needs to be near all other database files, except for the actual database. The database also should
contain entries, or all methods will not work. 

####Notes:
The API is almost complete but needs to be tested more before deployment.
